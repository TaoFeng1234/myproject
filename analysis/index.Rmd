Welcome to my first workflowr research website.

Summary of the biostat data set
```{r}
d <- read.csv("data/biostats.csv")
data(d)
summary(d)

print(paste("There are",nrow(d),"rows in biostats data set!"))
print(paste("There are",ncol(d),"cols in biostats data set!"))
```

statistical summary of the "age","weight" column and the plot their relationship
```{r}
summary(d$Age)
hist(d$Age, main = "histogrm of biostat Age")
```

```{r}
summary(d$Weight..lbs.)
hist(d$Weight..lbs., main = "histogrm of biostat weight")
```

```{r}
plot(d$Age,d$Weight..lbs.,xlab = "Age",ylab = "weight")
```

Now let's run a simple regression with weight against to sex,height,and age
```{r}
mod <- lm(d$Weight..lbs.~d$Sex+d$Height..in.+d$Age)
summary(mod)
```
