# Bubble plot of COvid-19 cases in the U.S.

Consider the COVID-19 cases in the U.S. New York Times has compiled the data via states and via counties. The data are available on github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data. You can also find the locations (latitude and longitude) of each state (or its capital) on the web. 

- obtain dataset 
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
#Load data
usstate <- read_csv("us-states.csv")
loc <- read_csv("us-state-capitals.csv")
names(loc)[1] <- "state"
usstate$date <-as.Date(usstate$date)
```

- Use the cumulative data of March 31, 2020 to obtain a bubble plot for the number of cases of the US.

```{R}
#collect march 31 data
march31<-usstate[usstate$date == '2020-03-31',]
#merging march 31 data with corresponding longtitude and latitude
df <- merge(march31,loc, by = "state")[c(-2,-11),] #take out Hawaii and Alaska
#plot
usa <- map_data("state")
ggplot() +
geom_path(data = usa, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
geom_point(data = df, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, size = cases),shape = 1, color = "red") +
  scale_size(range = c(.5, 20), name="Cases") +
  labs(x = "longtitudes", y = "lattitudes", title = "The number of cases of each states on March 31 ")
```

- Use the cumulative data of April 3, 2020 to obtain a bubble plot for the number of cases of the US. 

```{R message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#collect April 3 data
April<-usstate[usstate$date== '2020-04-03',]
#merging march 31 data with corresponding longtitude and latitude
df <- merge(April,loc, by = "state")[c(-2,-11),] #take out Hawaii and Alaska
#plot
usa <- map_data("state")
ggplot() +
geom_path(data = usa, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
geom_point(data = df, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, size = cases), shape = 1, color = "red") +
  scale_size(range = c(.5, 20), name="Cases")+
  labs(x = "longtitudes", y = "lattitudes", title = "The number of cases of each states on April 03 ")
```

- Compare and comment of the two bubble plots.

We can see significant increase of the cases from March 31 2020 to April 03 2020.
Northeastern region has the more cases than anyother region.
